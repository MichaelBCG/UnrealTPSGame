# Unreal Engine Automation And Testing

**TPS** is a simple **C++** project from **UE** templates.
We are using it for training **CI/CD**, automatization and testing in Unreal Engine, with **Jenkins** and **bat scripts**.

## Features

* UE source automatization (clone, setup, build, custom installed build)
* UE projects automatization (build, cook, package)
* Game, Client, Server (dedicated, listen) builds
* Code format with .clang-format
* Test automation, code coverage
* Documentation generation with doxygen
* Jenkins' pipelines
* GitHub webhooks, slack notifications, shceldures, ngrok etc.

## Info

The course started under UE4, and the engine version was changed in the middle of the course to UE5. But you can easily start with the UE5 version â€” all code bases will be the same.

The major part of this project is a **devops** folder where all automation scripts are left.
